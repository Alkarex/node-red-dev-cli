# Number of Dependencies

## Requirements
The tool will check the number of dependencies in the package.json and warn if there are more than 6. 
devDependencies are not counted.

## Reason
6 was chosen as 95% of all published Node-RED modules had less than 6 dependencies when tested (Oct 2021)
We do see occasionally packages including a large number of unused dependencies including the `node-red` package itself!
This isn't meant to be a hard limit just a warning to check that everything in your dependenceis list is indeed needed, its is recognised that some pacakges may have a legitimate reason to have a lot of dependencies and this can be noted in the README
