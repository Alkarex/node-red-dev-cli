# Min node-red version

## Requirements
With the `node-red` sectio of the package.json file the developer SHOULD indicate the mnimum supported version. This must staisfy at least one of the current `latest` or `maintanance` tagged releases.

eg
```
"node-red"  : {
    "version": ">=2.0.0",
}
```

## Reason
This is so that users can identify nodes that rely on new features in latest versions of node-red.
