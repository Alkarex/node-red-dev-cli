# Node-RED Keyword

## Requirements
The package.json must contain the keyword `node-red` eg

```
    "keywords": [ "node-red" ],
```

## Reason
This identifies the package as Node-RED modules rather than a more generic node package.

Without this keyword set, it will not be listed on the Flow Library.
